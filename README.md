## How it Works

The LeaderBoard web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of how each component contributes to its functionality:

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page and includes the following elements:

- A form with input fields for first name, last name, country, and player score.
- Error prompt for incomplete form submissions.
- A scoreboard section where player details are displayed.

### CSS (style tag)

The CSS file provides styles and layout for the application, ensuring a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience. It includes responsive design for different screen sizes.

### JavaScript (script tag)

JavaScript is responsible for the interactivity of the LeaderBoard application. Key functionalities include:

- Capturing user input and validating form submissions.
- Dynamically adding player entries to the scoreboard.
- Sorting the scoreboard based on player scores.
- Enabling buttons to increase, decrease, or remove player scores.
